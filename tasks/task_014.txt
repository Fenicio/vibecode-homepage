# Task ID: 14
# Title: Apply Neobrutalism Design Style Across UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Redesign all UI components and styles to reflect neobrutalism principles, using inspiration and templates from neobrutalism.dev. Ensure the updated design features bold colors, strong borders, playful shapes, and other key neobrutalism elements.
# Details:
Review the templates and best practices from https://www.neobrutalism.dev/templates to understand the core visual language of neobrutalism. Update the project's UI components to incorporate bold, vibrant color palettes, thick and high-contrast borders, playful and unconventional shapes, and strong, loud typography. Emphasize contrast and visual focal points using color, size, and texture. Add depth and tactile feel through shadows and layering, but maintain overall simplicity and clarity to avoid clutter. Remove unnecessary embellishments and ensure all elements serve a functional purpose. Prioritize readability and accessibility throughout the redesign. Reference real-world examples and guidelines from design resources to ensure authenticity and consistency with neobrutalism principles.

# Test Strategy:
Manually review all updated UI components to confirm the presence of neobrutalism features: bold colors, strong borders, playful shapes, and expressive typography. Compare the implementation against templates from neobrutalism.dev and other referenced resources. Validate that the design maintains clarity, readability, and accessibility. Conduct cross-device and cross-browser testing to ensure visual consistency. Solicit feedback from team members to verify the design aligns with neobrutalism best practices and project requirements.
