# Title: Fix and Style Theme Toggle Button for Responsive Navigation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the theme toggle button functions correctly and is visually consistent across both mobile and desktop navigation bars.
# Details:
Audit the current theme toggle button implementation to identify and resolve any issues with toggling between light and dark modes, ensuring the state is correctly managed and persists across sessions (e.g., using localStorage). Refactor the toggle button component to use accessible markup (e.g., labeled checkbox or button) and ensure it triggers theme changes reliably. Update and unify the styling for the toggle button so it matches the design system and looks polished on both mobile and desktop navigation bars. Use responsive CSS and test with various screen sizes to guarantee proper alignment, spacing, and touch targets. Consider using SVG icons (e.g., sun/moon) for visual feedback, and ensure transitions are smooth. Verify that the toggle is accessible via keyboard and screen readers.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test the toggle button on both mobile and desktop views to confirm it switches themes as expected and persists the user's choice after reloads. Check that the button is styled consistently and remains accessible and usable at all viewport sizes. Use browser dev tools to simulate mobile devices and test touch interactions. Validate keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility. Perform cross-browser testing to ensure consistent appearance and functionality. Optionally, write unit tests for the toggle logic and integration tests for theme persistence.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit and Analyze Current Theme Toggle Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing theme toggle button code and behavior to identify issues with toggling, state management, accessibility, and visual consistency across mobile and desktop navigation bars.
### Details:
Inspect the toggle button's logic for switching themes, how it stores and retrieves the theme state (e.g., localStorage), and its markup for accessibility. Document any inconsistencies or bugs, and note differences in appearance or behavior between mobile and desktop views.

## 2. Refactor Theme Toggle Logic and State Management [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Update the toggle button logic to ensure reliable theme switching, correct state management, and persistence across sessions, including syncing with system preferences.
### Details:
Implement a robust toggle handler that updates the theme both in memory and in the DOM, and saves the preference in localStorage. Add event listeners to detect system theme changes and update the UI accordingly. Ensure the theme preference cascade is: localStorage > system setting > default.

## 3. Implement Accessible and Semantic Toggle Markup [done]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Refactor the toggle button to use accessible markup, such as a labeled button or checkbox, ensuring it is operable via keyboard and screen readers.
### Details:
Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., <button> with aria-label or <input type='checkbox'> with a label). Ensure focus indicators are visible and ARIA attributes are set for screen reader compatibility. Add keyboard event handling for accessibility.

## 4. Unify and Polish Toggle Button Styling for Responsive Design [done]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Update and unify the toggle button's styling to match the design system and ensure visual consistency and usability across mobile and desktop navigation bars.
### Details:
Apply responsive CSS for alignment, spacing, and touch targets (minimum 44x44px). Use SVG icons (e.g., sun/moon) for visual feedback and smooth transitions. Ensure the button looks polished and consistent in both navigation contexts.

## 5. Verify Functionality, Responsiveness, and Accessibility [done]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing to ensure the theme toggle works correctly, is visually consistent, and meets accessibility standards across all supported devices and navigation bars.
### Details:
Test the toggle on both mobile and desktop, with different themes, and using assistive technologies. Validate keyboard navigation, screen reader output, and responsive behavior. Address any remaining issues.
