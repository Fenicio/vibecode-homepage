- **Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization

### MVP Scoping
- **Risk**: Feature creep without CMS constraints
- **Mitigation**: Strict MVP feature list and phased development
- **Risk**: Admin interface complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with basic admin features, enhance iteratively

### Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: More custom development required
- **Mitigation**: Use proven libraries and patterns
